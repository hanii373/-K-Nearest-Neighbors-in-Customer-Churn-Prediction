# KNN Customer Churn Prediction Example

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm applied to customer churn prediction.

## Description
The example demonstrates:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Training a KNN classifier
- Predicting customer churn
- Evaluating results using standard metrics

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Place `customer_churn.csv` in the same directory
2. Run:
   python knn_churn_example.py

## Notes
This example is intended for academic and educational purposes
to demonstrate similarity-based classification.
